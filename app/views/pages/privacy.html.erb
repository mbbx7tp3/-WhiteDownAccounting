<p> <strong> Your Privacy and White Down Accounting </strong> </p>
<p> White Down Accounting strongly believes in the importance of keeping the personal information of our candidates private. We will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the permissions you give us. </p>

<p>  <strong> What sort of data is collected? </strong> </p>
<p> We collect personal data about you to help in the recruitment process. This data consists of information such as your name, address, e-mail address, and work and education history, plus your nationality, which we are required to collect by law.

Personal information provided by you is retained as long as the purpose for which the data was collected continues. It is then archived or destroyed unless its retention is required to satisfy audit, legal, regulatory or accounting requirements or to protect White Down Accounting interests. White Down Accounting will not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others unless you have given us your permission.

White Down Accounting is registered as a data controller with the office of the Information Commissioner. This requires us to follow the Data Protection Act 1998. The 1998 Act provides for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals who are the subjects of personal data. “Personal data” includes all data, which relates to a living individual who can be identified from the data and which includes any expression of opinion about the individual and any indication of the intention of the data controller or any other person in respect of the individual.

Details of our company registration are available upon request. </p>

<p> <strong> Your Curriculum Vitae </strong> </p>
<p> When you register your Curriculum Vitae with White Down Accounting it will be made available to our consultants and prospective employers in connection with the recruitment process unless you request otherwise. Should you wish to request a change to our normal CV disclosure processes, please email whitedownas@gmail.com

If you would like a list of the companies that we have contacted on your behalf please feel free to contact your consultant. </p>

<p> <strong> Sensitive personal data </strong> </p>
<p> We collect and process sensitive personal data only so far as is necessary to ensure we conform with legal requirements, such as equal opportunities laws. By registering your details with us, you consent to us collecting and processing any sensitive personal data supplied by you such as details of trade union membership or religious affiliations but only details of ethnic origin will be used for equal opportunities monitoring. </p>

<p> <strong> Third parties </strong> </p>
<p> The security of your data is extremely important to us. Access to your personal data is only provided to our staff and third parties such as specific software suppliers to White Down Accounting, who help us to process data, and to prospective and intended employers in order to help with the recruitment process. </p>

<p> <strong> Job Applications </strong> </p>
<p> If you have applied for a job through White Down Accounting the information you provide will be used to determine your suitability for the position and, if applicable, in determining terms of employment or engagement. It may also be included in management information used to monitor recruitment initiatives and equal opportunities policies. If your application is progressed further, details may be disclosed to third parties (such as educational institutions, present and past employers, employees and directors of White Down Accounting, credit reference agencies, etc.) for reasons such as the verification of, or obtaining extra, information. Details may also be disclosed if required by law or for the purposes of White Down Accounting business requirements (e.g. to auditors or third party service suppliers).

If your application is unsuccessful, we may try to find you employment with alternative clients and may, therefore, disclose your details to other prospective employers and clients in connection with the recruitment process (which for these purposes includes the process of gaining employment and any ongoing administrative process involved, unless you tell us otherwise.) </p>

<p> <strong> Keeping you Informed </strong> </p>
<p> In order to keep our records up to date with your precise requirements you may from time to time receive relevant information and reminders from us connected to the service you have requested.
